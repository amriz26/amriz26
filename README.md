## 💫👨🏻‍💻About Me:
Hi there, I'm Ahmed! 👋 <br><br>

💭Who Am I?: Hello! I am a Software Engineer undergrad pursuing my Bachelors in CS, minor in Computing applications and a gSTAR certificte in Machine Learning and Data Science for BioTech @ San Francisco State University! In the field of tech, my interests vary from Autonomous systems, Machine Learning / AI, to Product Engineering and more! My skills vary with familiarity in various aspects of Software Engineer and development (frameworks, libraries, API, Databases, Application Documentation…etc) and I'm more than excited to bring my skills, learn, and apadpt to an organization that values and supports them. I aspire to secure a Software Engineer, Prodcut Deisgn / Manager Internship within my interests in an organization where I am committed to building upon and applying my knowledge and passion to create and turn ideas into innovative solutions to make a meaningful contribution to the tech industry! ᯤ <br> <br>

<br>🌐What's my experience looking like?: I'm a software engineering student who loves building things that actually work. Through my internships + contract work, I've gotten to dive deep into fullstack development, AI agents, Autonomous Systems and fine-tuning AI models and LLMS. Here's a look at some recent projects where I got to work with cool new tools and technologies to create solutions that made a real difference. <br> <br>

⚙️What am I learning?: I'm actively expanding my toolkit and skillset in web application development through Next.js and React, while also delving into the realm of mobile development using Flutter. Additionally, I'm exploring the exciting fields of Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing, particularly focusing on tools like TensorFlow and OpenAI to enhance my understanding and capabilities in these cutting-edge areas. Embracing a collaborative mindset, I am open to partnerships. This journey not only involves mastering existing skills but also adapting to and embracing new frameworks and tools like Next.js, Flutter, AWS & more, which represent exciting prospects for future web applications and mobile development (new tools for me!).👾 <br> <br> 

<br> </>What are some projects I am working on?: I am currently working on addiontal features for Budept Pal, a user-friendly budget tracking app (created during the CalHacks HFI Hackathon)! I'm currently focused on adding some exciting features to Budept Pal, like machine learning and an AI chatbot. These upgrades will help users by providing smart financial and budgeting advice. With AI, the app will predict budgets and spot unusual spending habits, giving personalized and real-time guidance to make managing money easier and more intuitive. I am also mapping out on an idea / getting started on co developing a real estate agent matching web application called ConnectEstate. this will be dev using the MERN stack and API integration, the app revolutionizes the real estate industry by seamlessly linking users with top notch real estate agents through an intuitive user friendly interface, detailed agent profiles, authentic reviews, and secure messaging, ensuring agent-client collaboration satisfaction and efficiency. You can check out my projects under my repositories🦾 <br> <br> 

<br>💭Ask me about: new technologies/ frameworks / libraries! When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me exploring new tech trends, outside with the world, or dreaming up my next big idea🚀 <br><br> 📫How to reach out to me?: Linkedin (attached in profile) <br><br>
